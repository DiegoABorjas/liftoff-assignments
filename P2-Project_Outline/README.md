# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a web application that helps people find other people around their area to play soccer with. I am still trying to figure out exactly how this will work but so far I've thought about allowing people to first register onto the site. Once they register they get to choose the option to either be a free agent (an individual who is looking for a team or more people to play with), or a Team (an individual with other friends who are looking for more people to play with). People then will have the option to find others around their area (still not sure on how this will work I might just do a basic filter by City OR if possible and not too complicated will try to use a location based using Google Maps. If this is too complicated this could be a future part of the project) that are looking for a team or just more people to play with.
### Features
* User register and login: Users will register, then they can decide to show themselves available as a free agent or as a team looking for more players.
* Users can show themselves as available looking for other players or turn it off once they have already found a team to play in. Similarly if a Team has enough users they can choose to no longer show themselves as available.
* Users would have the option to edit the info, or delete a team if they wish to.
* For now I will just use the email (which users will put in when they register) as way of contacting between the users.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I am not sure how connecting a database works with JavaScript/Angular. So far I've only worked with JSON files, so I will need to figure this out.
